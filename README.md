# ePicProject

Interactive adventure type video game powered by Unity (C#)

## Issues
Issues on built version about inventory display between scenes. Changing scene may cause a reset of the graphical display of the inventory (inventory empty). However, items are still in possession of the player. Debug version works perfectly. The issues may be the result of a Unity update.
